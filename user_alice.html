      <p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
        and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:
        a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep,
        and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it,
        and the talking over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice;
        `only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’</p>

      <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together
        at one corner of it: `No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice coming.
        `There’s PLENTY of room!’ said Alice indignantly,
        and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>

      <p>`Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
      Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
      `I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
      `There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.
      `Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.
      `It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,’ said the March Hare.
      `I didn’t know it was YOUR table,’ said Alice; `it’s laid for a great many more than three.’</p>

      <p>`Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter.
        He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity,
        and this was his first speech.
      `You should learn not to make personal remarks,’ Alice said with some severity;
      `it’s very rude.’ The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this;
      but all he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?’</p>

      <p>`Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought Alice.
        `I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.–I believe I can guess that,’
        she added aloud. `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’
        said the March Hare. `Exactly so,’</p>
