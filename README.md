Temporary project to test setup and possibly a simple web site for a project

Testing git cloning...  
Testing git pushing...  
Testing git pulling...  

-Note that the Author of commits is not currently correct, since git wasn't correctly configured on the client.  
-Website files will be added, but no particular setup is currently planned.  
-Moved local git folder. Minor change in index.html.  

v0.1: Have a decent-looking site. The following things to consider:  
-Make images into links.  
-Having some content that is static across the site (banner- and footer elements).  
-Check out basta.se (carousel, user review etc.).
