Temporary project to test setup and possibly a simple web site for a project

Testing git cloning...  
Testing git pushing...  
Testing git pulling...  

-Note that the Author of commits is not currently correct, since git wasn't correctly configured on the client.  
-Website files will be added, but no particular setup is currently planned.  
-Moved local git folder. Minor change in index.html.  

v0.1: Have a decent-looking site. The following things to consider:  
-Make images into links.  
-Having some content that is static across the site (banner- and footer elements).  
-Check out basta.se (carousel, user review etc.).  

v0.15: Going to attempt changing the css to use grid.  
-Grid has been implemented for a section on the page.  
-Updated banner and footer to look more like they're intended to.  

v0.2: Several possibilities. Planning to attempt to make additional pages and links.  
-Could add menus as a next step.  
-Under development...
