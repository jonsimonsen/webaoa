Using my repo for these files for now. The project owner is Troms√∏ kommune.  
A different solution for version control should probably be implemented before the scope of the project becomes too large.

pre-versions:  
-Note that the Author of commits is not always correct, since git wasn't correctly configured on the client at the start of the project.  
-Website files will be added, but no particular setup is currently planned.  
-Moved local git folder. Minor change in index.html.  

v0.1: Have a decent-looking site. The following things to consider:  
-Make images into links.  
-Having some content that is static across the site (banner- and footer elements).  
-Check out external site (carousel, user review etc.).  

v0.15: Going to attempt changing the css to use grid.  
-Grid has been implemented for a section on the page.  
-Updated banner and footer to look more like they're intended to.  

v0.2: Several possibilities. Planning to attempt to make additional pages and links.  
-Could add menus as a next step.  
-Under development...  
-Added navbar. No links provided yet (TODO).  
-Refactored banner to use flexbox (easier vertical alignment inside divs).  
-Added some links (so far only internal). Some are styled as buttons.  
-Using fixed position for the banner, and added a placeholder image under it.
