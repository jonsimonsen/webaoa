TODOS:

-Refactoring code (banner, footer, storylinks etc.).
-Consider looking more closely at fonts.
-Consider looking more closely at scss.
-possibly making a dynamic div that can alternate between DREIS and DagsJobben.

-Refactor JS/Jquery (look into keeping utility functions and test functions in separate files).
