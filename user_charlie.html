      <p>“Ah, my pretty little cows!” cried Mr Wonka. “How I love those cows!”
        “But why can’t we see them?” asked Veruca Salt.

      <p>FIZZY LIFTING DRINKS, it said on the next door.
        “Oh, those are fabulous!” cried Mr Wonka. “They fill you with bubbles,
        and the bubbles are full of a special kind of gas,
        and this gas is so terrifically lifting that it lifts you right off the ground just like a balloon,
        and up you go until your head hits the ceiling – and there you stay.”
        “But how do you come down again?”</p>
